Welcome to my fourth portfolio project. In this data analysis practice project, I query and analyse a sales dataset of "Awesome Chocolates", a dataset from Chandoo.org containing data on sales, salespeople, products and geographies (countries / regions).

Project Guide

I use SQL to extensively query the Awesome Chocolates sales dataset across 4 table - "Sales", "People", "Products" and "Geo" (location). This analysis includes various filters and sorts for drill-down analysis by individual sales people and teams, locations, products, as well as "CASE" statements for selecting and displaying results in a specific required format convenient for analysis.

This initially started as a session for me to practice my SQL querying and analysis, but as I went further and went through it over again, the code and explanatory notes were clean enough that I uploaded it here to GitHub.
